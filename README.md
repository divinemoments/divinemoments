# Analytical Storyteller
I’m a numbers enthusiast who loves crunching data and solving problems. I have work experience in market research and central banking, plus an educational background in economics, finance, and business. But now, I am a professor of statistics and research. As a self-taught data analyst, I’m using this GitHub to showcase my projects and hopefully inspire others. Let’s chat, exchange analyses and uncover actionable insights!
